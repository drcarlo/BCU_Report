\chapter{Presentation Slides}
One can readily prepare presentation slides using PowerPoint or Keynote. Saving / Exporting the slides as a pdf document allows for it to be easily incorporated into this template. Each slide will be scaled to 0.45 of the \textbackslash textwidth, individual pages of the file can be accessed via the page=x option of \textbackslash includegraphics.

\chapter{Project Log}

The following is a weekly summary of the work carried during the development of this body of work. It covers tasks that were completed, tutorials that were worked through, articles that were read and summaries of discussions / meetings held with the project supervisor and other third parties. 

\section*{Week Beginning: Monday 26/09/2016}

First week working on the project. Had a meeting with supervisor and discussed some of the issues related to the project. The first deliverable is due for the end of next week (project outline \& ethics form). 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Downloaded and Installed \latex (MikTeX full install) \& Winshell. 
  \item Started to get to grips with the \latex system by making simple modifications to the template and editing the project log.
  \item Developed a Mind Map to clarify understanding of project elements.
  \item Prepared an initial draft of project plan in the form of a Gantt chart. 
  \item Prepared and revised draft of project proposal \& filled in ethics form. 
  \item Downloaded and read half a dozen BSc Reports to see the general format and expected content.
